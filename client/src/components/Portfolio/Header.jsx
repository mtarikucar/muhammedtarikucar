              I am a final year computer engineering student with a keen
              interest in robotics and full-stack web technologies. During my
              high school and university years, I participated in many
              competitions and won awards in the field of robotics. Through
              internships in my professional life, I gained experience in
              product development and project management. Currently, I am
              continuing to work towards gaining expertise in IOT, network
              systems, and particularly full-stack (backend-heavy) technologies.
